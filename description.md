Linear models don't always handle categorical data well. And yet, categorical predictors are common in classification rating plans. Credibility has long been a tool which can smooth predictions across segments. This presentation will illustrate decision trees and naive Bayes as alternatives to a strict credibility-focused modeling approach. 

Participants will appreciate the significance of categorical predictors in their data and how to incorporate it in their models.

Participants will understand the basics of decision trees and random forests and why they may be preferred over GLMs.
